# Golfi Web
As golfers ourselves, we know how difficult it is to connect with local golfing communities and join golf tournaments for suitable skill levels. We also understand the frustration of tournament organizers to advertise and manage their tournaments efficiently.

Therefore, we designed Golfi, a free website providing simple yet powerful tools for creating, joining, managing, and sponsoring golf tournaments.
